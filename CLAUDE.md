# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository state

This repo is at the planning stage: it contains `README.md`, `AGENTS.md` and
`docs/BLUEPRINT.md` and **no source code, build system or tests yet**. There are
therefore no build/lint/test commands to document — when the first code lands,
add them here.

The `.gitignore` already anticipates the stack (Python: `__pycache__/`, `.venv/`,
`.pytest_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `*.egg-info/`), so `pytest` and `ruff` are the
expected test/lint tools unless a deliberate decision changes that.

## What issuebot is

A bespoke reimplementation of [openai/symphony](https://github.com/openai/symphony)
built on Claude + GitHub instead of Codex + Linear. Full requirements live in
`docs/BLUEPRINT.md`; the essentials:

A service watches for new GitHub issues, picks them up, works on them
autonomously via `claude -p` in auto mode, opens a PR for human review, and files
follow-up issues where needed.

**Issue lifecycle is driven by labels**, and the label is the state machine —
anything reading or writing issue state goes through these:

| Label | Set by |
|---|---|
| `issuebot/todo` | human |
| `issuebot/in-progress` | agent, when work starts |
| `issuebot/review` | agent, when PR opened |
| `issuebot/rework` | human, if the PR needs more work |
| `issuebot/complete` | automatically, when the issue closes via linked-PR merge |

GitHub is reached through the `gh` CLI, not a REST/GraphQL client library.

Two surfaces beyond the worker: a **web dashboard** (Kanban of the label columns
above, plus hero stats — issues closed in 1d/7d, agents spun up, as both
point-in-time numbers and time series) and **Slack notifications** on status
change. Persisting the time-series history is what PostgreSQL is for.

Planned infrastructure: Docker, Python 3.14, PostgreSQL, GitHub Actions CI
(lint, tests, docker build) and Dependabot.

## Operational rules (from AGENTS.md)

`AGENTS.md` is binding for agents in this repo. Read it, and note in particular:

- **Never push to `main`.** Push a feature branch and open a PR for human
  review. Never merge or close PRs — that is a human action.
- **Never run destructive commands**: `rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`,
  `git clean -fd`.
- **The repo is used from both Windows and Linux hosts.** Detect the OS before
  emitting shell commands or scripts: Bash/`.sh`/`&&` on Linux/macOS,
  PowerShell/`.ps1`/`;` on Windows. Never generate `.ps1` on Linux or `.sh` on
  Windows.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` must exist, with `trailing-whitespace` and
  `end-of-file-fixer` from pre-commit-hooks. If any `.tf` files are added, also
  wire up `terraform_fmt`, `terraform_validate` and `terraform_tflint` from
  antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform.

## Creating PRs

Per the user's global instructions, set PR title/body via the REST API rather
than `gh pr create`/`gh pr edit` (the CLI hits a deprecated `projectCards`
GraphQL field and aborts here); a PreToolUse hook enforces this. Write the body
to a temp `.md` file in a **separate** Bash call from the `gh api` call, and pass
it with capital `-F body=@file.md`.
